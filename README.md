# The Nobel Prize

This mini-project was kick started when I heard Greta Thunberg (young climate activist) was nominated for the prize. Suriprised by the nomination I had more questions than answers and I became motivated to learn about the past Nobel prize winners.

This notebook will answer the following:
- Who gets the most nobel prizes by country and sex
- What is a percantage of winners were born in the USA by decade
- Typical gender of the Nobel prize winner by categories
- The first women to win the nobel prize 
- Who are the repeated laureates
- Age distribution of the winners and difference between categories
- Oldest and youngest winners

Data ranges from 1901 - 2016. The dataset was made available by the The Nobel Foundation. 

Note: Code required to clean and join tables is not included in this notebook.
