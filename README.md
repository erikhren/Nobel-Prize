# The Nobel Prize

This mini-project was kick started when I heard Greta Thunberg (young climate activist) was nominated for the prize. Suriprised by the nomination I had more questions and answers about the past Nobel prize winners and here we are.

This notebook will answer the following:
- Who gets the most nobel prizes by country and sex
- What is a percantage of winners were born in the USA by decade
- Typical gender of the Nobel prize winner by categories
- The first women to win the nobel prize 
- Who are the repeated laureates
- Age distribution of the winners and difference between categories
- Oldest and youngest winners

In this notebook we will explore the Nobel prize winners from 1901 - 2016. The dataset was made available by the The Nobel Foundation. 

Note: Data cleaning code is not included in the notebook.
